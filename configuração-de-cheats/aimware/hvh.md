# HvH

HvH aka hack vs hack is a "gamemode" that has been around as long as cheats have existed. Here cheaters play against other cheaters usually on community servers with VAC disabled using the rage bot. This gamemode is basically a sandbox where cheaters go against each other to see who has the best cheat/config.

In HvH with most public/private cheats the cheat itself doesnt make that huge of a differnce to your preformance, the two most important factors are your playstyle and your config. This guide should help you understand the basics of configing and will explain how to adapt settings to your playstyle (e.g agressive, defensive, semi agressive and pussy 1wer)

## Making a config

The first step to making your hvh config is to determine your playstyle in hvh. Once you have determined that then you can move on to making your own config by following the steps/guide below:

First off, the "Aimbot" tab:

Most of the features here are self explanitory so ill only go over the ones that are important here.

FOV: The field of view of the rage bot aka where the rbot will aim.
Always set this to 180 degrees since ur hvhing.

Aim Lock: This forces the rbot to aim at one target until it is killed.
Dont recommend having this on since in some senarios its better to take shots at multiple enemies and not just focus on one.

Knife bot: Automatically stabs with your knife depending on the mode selected.
I recommend quick stab or only backstab depending on how you push people with your knife out.

Now onto the "Accuracy" tab:

Here the features dont need explination so I will just guide you on what to set values to.

Slowwalk:
I dont recommend going over 30% on this, I usually go for something around 15-25%.

Zeus:
From my experience with aimware the best settings to use for the zeus are,
85% hit chance,
90+ minimum damage.

Pistols:
Depending on the agressiveness of your playstyle you would want to lower the hit chance to be able to shoot at higher speeds,
Between 20-65% hit chance again depending on how agressively you play with pistols,
Between 8-20 depending on the pistol you are using, lower for lower damage pistols,
Double tap can be used on all pistols so use at your own will.

Heavy Pistols:

Submachine Guns:

Rifles:

Shotguns:

Scout:

Auto Snipers:

AWP:

LMGs:
