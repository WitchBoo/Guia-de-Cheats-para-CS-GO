# Internal vs External

Most big pay2cheat are internal, due to their much better efficiency. All HvH cheats are internal since HvH requires constant accurate timing and external is very delayed compared to internal.

Internal means the whole cheat is injected into the CS:GO process. No other window for the menu.

Externals are usually separate windows and can be slower. Almost always used only for legit. You could go blatant with it, but definitely not spin.

Pros and Cons: internals Pros: Internals are more efficient, can HvH, and are usually better. there is MUCH documentation on internals on github, unknowncheats, and mpgh. Cons: C++ is difficult to learn from zero coding experience. \(at least personally! -2772\)

Pros and cons: Externals pros: Can use more techniques against detection \(low ring for example\), easy to write for basic features compared to c++ \(again, personally -2772\) cons: much less efficient, can be laggy if not optimized

What ISN'T different between the 2: detection is not easier or harder on internal or external. They are about the individual cheat.
