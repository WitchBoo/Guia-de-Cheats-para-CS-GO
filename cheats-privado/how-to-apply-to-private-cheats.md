# How to apply for private cheats

Private cheats are either invite only or application based. Don't beg for invites. Make friends with those that can get invites and NEVER ask directly. Invite based cheats are centered around the idea that the community chooses who gets in, while application based cheats are mostly for when the admins want to vet everyone who gets in, which is fair as well.

## Invites

Some private cheats have a invitation code for it's users so share out, in order to let their friends can join their community. However, some users find out it is a way to make some quick cash by selling invites. And soon, a lot of people followed. However, some of them are maybe scammers who claimed to have inivte code for sale, which we will cover [in a later page](misc). However, the best way to get a inivte code is to make friends, or make yourself famous in HvH servers by using public cheats first. Then someone will give you a private cheat invite soon after.

## Applications

There are private cheats allow applications for people to apply. Some of them have a limited application slot \(ev0lve\) while some didn't \(Novolinehook\). Mostly if you made an application, which you have to introduce yourself, briefly, and most importantly, cheating experience. Then they will have an interview with you , mostly talking about your cheating experience. Usually if you don't behave rude during the interview and don't act like a prankster, also have some cheating experience they will usually let you join their community.
