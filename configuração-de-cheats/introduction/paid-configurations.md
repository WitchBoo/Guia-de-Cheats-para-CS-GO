# Paid configurations

You may see lot's of famous youtubers are dominating in every hvh match, while you only barely killing a player. Then theese youtubers told you to join their membership to get access to their configs. You instantly join their membership, download their config, try it out... And nothing changed. You're still gettting killed by other players, with yourself still wondering "How am I still doing badly, even though I am using their config?"

## Configs don't represent the whole picture

A good config can help you to get more kills, but the most important thing is your playstyle. You need both to to dominate a match. Also, there is the sad truth that you may not be using the same config as the youtubers are using themselves, which means they might be selling a fake config. Even if they are selling the same config as they show in their videos, you still have the chance that it might not suit your playstyle, because its made for their own playstyle and not yours.

## Leaked Configs

It's inevitable that youtubers configs get leaked and if you know where to look you can find almost any youtubers config you want. A good place to start is by looking at leaking websites and the cheat forums themselves, there are a ton of good congifs for free on the forums. Some may be over hyped in the title, like they always are, but doesnt hurt to try them.

Here are some examples of config-leaking websites:

* [Matt1's leaked configuration collection](https://old.reddit.com/r/Csgohacks/comments/f1wdlb/freak_config_pack_reuploaded/)
* [Teeesense.xyz](https://teeesense.xyz/forums/)
* [Streetwits.xyz](https://streetwits.xyz/forums/)
* [Void.to](https://void.to/)
* hentaiware.moe
* [sleek.rip](https://sleek.rip/home.php)
* [horrid.pw](https://horrid.pw/)
* [clowned.cc](https://forum.clowned.cc/)
* failure.website
* [spamtec.cc](http://spamtec.cc/)

Some of the aformentioned websites are invite only sadly, but in the end almost all the websites have the same leaked configs.

Some youtubers (Freak) have made massive cfg packs with hundreds of cfgs to try some paid, some public.
